# Kings-Scheduler
This is a program that I wrote to automate my class scheduling and ensure that its done once my registration time opens up.
This program is one that will only work for my particular school since it works by interacting with the HTML elements of the web page.

I used the Selenium package to do so. Currently there is no GUI so it works from the command line. The program currently works by prompting the user for all of the necessary information it will need in order to schedule them for classes. Once you run it, it will begin asking for the information and at the very end it will open up a web browser. 5 minutes before the student's registration time it will begin to navigate to the registration page and set up everything it can before the registration time opens. Once the registration time hits it will click submit.

I personally used this program so that I wouldn't have to wake up for my 7am registration time because as long as my computer doesnt shut off I can run it before I go to bed and wake up to all my classes registered for.
